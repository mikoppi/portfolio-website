                <p>Hello! I am a frontend focused web developer from Finland.
                I have always found all kind of problem solving to be intriguing. 
                Eventually I found out that solving problems while building the digital world is the most
                interesting and rewarding field for me. So here I am now!
                </p>
                <p>Right now I feel most comfortable with <span style={{color: "#98ebad"}}>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js and React.js). </span>
                   But I am always willing to learn new technologies and skills. Next, I am going to learn TypeScript and start using it in my upcoming projects.
                </p>
                <p>I am open to any suggestions/questions/requests that you might have. </p>
                <p><span style={{color: " #d4a375", fontWeight:"bold"}}>Let's work together! </span></p>
