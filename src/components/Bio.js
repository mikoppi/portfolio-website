                <p>Hello! I am a frontend focused web developer from Finland.
                I have always found all kind of problem solving to be intriguing. 
                Eventually I found out that solving problems while building the digital world is the most
                interesting and rewarding field for me. So here I am now!
                </p>
                <p>At the moment I am diving more into backend development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.
                  I am also planning to learn TypeScript soon.
                </p>
                <p>Let's work together!</p>
